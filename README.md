-New design

-New texture manager layout

-Refinements (Disabled Save(as), Zoom & Hitbox/Texture manager when a file isn't loaded)

-Bug fixes - Fixed a bug that'll cause the app to crash by saving when a file wasn't loaded, not that you can do this anymore anyways but it's fixed üëçüëçüëç / This also applies to a faulty save in general, because it uses Try() & Catch() to prevent the app from crashing

-Fixed a crash when opening an unsupported file

-NEW PLAYABLE CHARACTERS

-New UI animations

-Added rearrangement support for animations in the list

Removals:

-You can no longer delete a file when removing it from your texture list







(Still missing a ton of things & performance isn't the best, so there's no releases right now, compile it from source if you really want it)
